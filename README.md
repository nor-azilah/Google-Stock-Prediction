# Google Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM using TensorFlow

This project aims to forecast Google's stock prices using historical data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It includes both single-step and multi-step forecasting approaches. The code and instructions below outline the process from data preprocessing to model training and visualization.


## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources to predict Google's stock prices using LSTM networks. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing to clean, normalize, and prepare the historical stock data.
- Data windowing for input-output pairs using the WindowGenerator class.
- Construction of an LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- Training the model and evaluating its performance on testing data.
- Visualization of predictions and actual stock prices.


## Installation









## Results
After running the code, you will find:

Predicted stock price plots alongside actual stock price labels.
Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for performance assessment.
Feel free to interpret the results and adjust the model settings to improve forecasting accuracy.
